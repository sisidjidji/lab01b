## growth mindset :
a growth mindset for me is working harder on our selfs than we normaly do , push our selfs over the limits and never give up specialy when it gets hard and difficult or  when we are exausted from trying and my main keys to keep my in a growth mindset is:
1. never give up.
2. been optimistic and see the best side of everything.
3. tell my self everytime that if someone can so i can too .
